# Test Pygame Framework
I intend to use and make:
* An ECS (Entity-Component-System) that handles the creation and removal of entities-- which are made of components
* A State Machine for the different game states such as various kinds of menus, scenes, etc.
* General-purpose components and systems-- much like a "standard library" of components and systems

This is fully extensible so that different use cases can be fulfilled-- pygame will be the main focus as of the time of writing this (2018-02-14) though, and as such this will have stuff related to that.
